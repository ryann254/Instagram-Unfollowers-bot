Incase your want to use this project just git clone it to your local computer.
Open it in pycharm or vscode and make sure all the necessary dependencies are installed e.g. this project needs 
selenium to work so make sure you 'pip install selenium'.
Also make sure you download the chrome webdriver, here's a helpful link on where to get it...https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads.
When you're done with that insert your instagram username on the line that I've named username(line 67).
Then go into the secrets.py and insert your password

# Caution
When uploading it to your github account remember to remove your instagram username and password for security purposes.
